7. The best way to check the dimensions (distance or angle between parts) is to go to the respective part or assembly's drawing like shown in the above figure. To check a particular dimension, use the point-to-point, point-to-line, line-to-line, angle, etc. dimension tool, and click on a pair of points/lines.
